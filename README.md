## 🛠️ **Libraries and Technologies** 💻 **Used**:
Our codebase harnesses the simplicity of **Python** 🐍 and its **Turtle** 🐢 library to create beautiful designs. Below is a breakdown of the **Libraries and Technologies** 💻 and their functionalities:

- `turtle` 🐢 – A standard Python library to create amazing 2D drawings and designs 🐢✍️.
- `random` 🎲 – Generate random colors, movements, or shapes for unique designs 🎲🎨.
- `math` 📐 – Used to compute complex shapes and figures, such as circles, spirals, and more 📐📏.
- `time` 🕒 – To add delays, create animations, or manage time-related functions 🕒⏱️.
- `tkinter` 🖼️ – The underlying GUI framework that **Turtle** 🐢 uses for rendering graphics 🎨🖼️.
- `os` 💻 – For handling file system tasks such as saving/loading graphics and interacting with the environment 💻🗂️.
- `PIL` 🖼️ – For advanced image manipulation and saving turtle graphics as image files 🖼️🖌️.
- `numpy` 🔢 – (Optional) For handling advanced mathematical operations in **Turtle** 🐢-based projects 🧮.
- `dataclasses` 🧩 – For managing structured data when building complex **Turtle** 🐢-based designs 🧩💼.
